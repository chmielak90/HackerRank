## Task
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, *N* as a parameter and prints the result of *N!* (*N* factorial).

### Note: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of .

## Input Format

A single integer, *N*(the argument to pass to *factorial*).

## Constraints
* 2<=*N*<=12
* Your submission must contain a recursive function named *factorial*.

## Output Format

Print a single integer denoting *N!*.

## Sample Input
```javascript
3
```
## Sample Output
```javascript
6
```
## Explanation

Consider the following steps:
1. *factorial*(3) = 3 x *factorial*(2)
2. *factorial*(2) = 2 x *factorial*(1)
3. *factorail*(1) = 1

From steps 2 and 3, we can say *factorial*(2) = 2 x 1 = 2; then when we apply the value from *factorial*(2) to step 1, we get *factorial*(3) = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. Thus, we print 6 as our answer.

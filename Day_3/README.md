# Task
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

    If n is odd, print `Weird`
    If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print `Not Weird`
    If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print `Weird`
    If n is even and greater than 20, print `Not Weird`

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not is weird.

# Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, n.

# Constraints

# Output Format

Print `Weird` if the number is weird; otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

# Sample Input 0

```javascript 3 ```

# Sample Output 0

```javascript Weird ```

# Sample Input 1

```javascript 24 ```

# Sample Output 1

```javascript Not Weird ```

# Explanation

Sample Case 0:n = 3
is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Case 1:n = 3
and is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
